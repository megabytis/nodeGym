# Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture

## 0. Definition

- **Monolithic Architecture**:  
  A single unified codebase where all functionalities (UI, business logic, database access) are part of one large application.

- **Microservices Architecture**:  
  An application is broken down into multiple small, independent services.  
  Each service handles a specific business function and communicates with others via APIs.

---

## 1. Development Speed

- **Monolith**: Faster to start for small projects; all code in one place.
- **Microservices**: Slower initially due to multiple setups, but faster long-term for large teams.

---

## 2. Code Repository

- **Monolith**: Single repo; easy to manage initially but grows messy as codebase expands.
- **Microservices**: Multiple repos (one per service) or a monorepo with isolated services.

---

## 3. Scalability

- **Monolith**: Must scale the entire application, even if only one part needs more resources.
- **Microservices**: Can scale individual services independently (cost-efficient).

---

## 4. Deployment

- **Monolith**: Entire app redeployed for any change.
- **Microservices**: Each service deployed independently (supports rolling/canary deployments).

---

## 5. Tech Stack

- **Monolith**: Single tech stack across the app.
- **Microservices**: Each service can use a different tech stack suited to its function.

---

## 6. Infrastructure Cost

- **Monolith**: Lower infra cost for small projects.
- **Microservices**: Higher initial infra cost due to multiple servers, containers, monitoring tools.

---

## 7. Complexity

- **Monolith**: Simpler architecture but harder to maintain as it grows.
- **Microservices**: More complex (service discovery, inter-service communication, CI/CD pipelines).

---

## 8. Fault Isolation

- **Monolith**: Failure in one module can crash the whole system.
- **Microservices**: Fault in one service usually does not affect others (if designed well).

---

## 9. Testing

- **Monolith**: Easier to run end-to-end tests, but takes longer as the app grows.
- **Microservices**: Unit tests are easier; integration tests are harder.

---

## 10. Ownership

- **Monolith**: One large codebase shared by many teams; less clear ownership.
- **Microservices**: Each team owns one or more services fully.

---

## 11. Maintenance

- **Monolith**: Becomes harder to update over time; tech debt accumulates.
- **Microservices**: Easier to maintain individual services.

---

## 12. Revamps

- **Monolith**: Changing tech stack or architecture requires rewriting large portions.
- **Microservices**: Individual services can be rewritten or replaced without affecting others.

---

## 13. Debugging

- **Monolith**: Easier to debug locally (single process).
- **Microservices**: Harder to debug due to distributed nature (requires logs aggregation, tracing).

---

## 14. Developer Experience

- **Monolith**: Simple onboarding; one environment to set up.
- **Microservices**: Steeper learning curve; developers must understand multiple systems, APIs, and pipelines.
