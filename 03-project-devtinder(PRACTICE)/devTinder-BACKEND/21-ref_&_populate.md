# What is 'ref' in Mongoose?

    - In MongoDB, there's no concept of joins like in SQL databases. To relate documents from different collections, we store references (usually the _id) of one document inside another.
      üîπ ref stands for "reference"
    - In Mongoose schemas, the ref option tells Mongoose which model the referenced _id belongs to.

**üìå Example: User and Post relationship**

- Imagine we have two collections:
  User ‚Äî stores user info
  Post ‚Äî stores blog posts, each written by a user

- We want each Post to reference its author (User).
- How will i do ?

üß© Schema Definition

```js
// models/User.js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number,
  email: String,
  course: String,
});

module.exports = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);
```

```js
// models/Post.js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const postSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  content: String,
  author: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: "User", // üëà This tells Mongoose: "This ID refers to a User document"
  },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model("Post", postSchema);
```

- üí° ref: 'User' must match the model name we passed to mongoose.model('User', ...). It's case-sensitive!

# NOW, What is populate()?

    - populate() is a Mongoose method that replaces the referenced ObjectId with the actual document from the referenced collection.

```js
// example :--

// Create a user
const user = new User({
  name: "Miku",
  age: 21,
  email: "miku@studying.com",
  course: "BCA",
});
await user.save();

// Create a post referencing that user
const post = new Post({
  title: "Miku's Post",
  content: "Learning Mongoose",
  author: user._id,
});
await post.save();

// WITHOUT "Populate()"
const foundPost_without_populate = await Post.findById(post._id);
console.log(foundPost_without_populate);
/*
Output :
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  title: "Miku's Post",
  content: "Learning Mongoose",
  author: ObjectId("64a1b2c3d4e5f67890abc123"), // Just an ID
  __v: 0
}
*/

// With "Populate()"
// Fetch post WITH user data
/*
syntax : popultae("a","b",c....)

here 
a = current model's one field having another model's _Id, where in schema "ref" is being written
b, c, .... = another model's / referenced model's fields, whom we wanna fetch. (OPTIONAL)
- but if we don't pass b,c,.... it will give everything/every fields of target model/ referenced model, so better fetch some specific data.

*/
const foundPost_with_populate = await Post.findById(post._id).populate(
  "author", // üëà Tell Mongoose to replace 'author' with User data
  // ["name", "email"],
  // or we can also pass like;
  "name email"
); // populate only name and email

/*
What exactly happens in background:
1. Mongoose sees .populate("author") and looks at the schema
2. It finds ref: "User", so it knows to query the "users" collection
3. It takes the ObjectId in "author" field and searches for matching _id
4. It replaces the ObjectId with the actual User document, i.e.
const user = new User({
  name: "Miku",
  age: 21,
  email: "miku@studying.com",
  course: "BCA",
});

5. ["name", "email"] limits the fetched fields (projection) for efficiency
*/

console.log(foundPost_with_populate);

/*
now Output will come like :
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  title: "Miku's Post",
  content: "Learning Mongoose",
  author: {
    _id: ObjectId("64a1b2c3d4e5f67890abc123"),
    name: "Miku",
    email: "miku@studying.com",
  }
  __v: 0
}
*/
```

- we can populate also multiple fields
