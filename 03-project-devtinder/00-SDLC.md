# Waterfall Model â€“ Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The **Waterfall Model** is a **linear and sequential** approach to software development.  
Each phase must be completed before the next begins, and the flow is strictly top-to-bottom, like a waterfall.

## 1. Requirements Phase

**Role:** Project Manager (PM) & Designer

**Activities:**

- Gather business requirements from clients/stakeholders.
- Document functional and non-functional requirements.
- Identify constraints, timelines, and scope.

**Output:**

- Requirement Specification Document (RSD)

---

## 2. Design Phase

**Role:** Senior Engineer / Engineering Manager (EM)

**Activities:**

- **High-Level Design (HLD):** System architecture, module breakdown, data flow diagrams.
- **Low-Level Design (LLD):** Component-level details, APIs, database schema.
- UI/UX prototypes creation.

**Output:**

- Design Document

## 3. Development Phase

**Role:** SDE1, SDE2 (Software Development Engineers)

**Activities:**

- Write code according to design specifications.
- Follow coding standards and use version control.
- Perform unit testing during development.

**Output:**

- Source Code + Unit Test Results

---

## 4. Testing Phase

**Role:** SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test)

**Activities:**

- Write and execute test cases.
- Perform functional, integration, system, and regression testing.
- Report and track defects.

**Output:**

- Test Report

---

## 5. Deployment Phase

**Role:** DevOps / Deployment Engineers

**Activities:**

- Prepare deployment scripts.
- Monitor deployment for failures.
- Ensure rollback plans are ready.

**Output:**

- Live Software

---

## 6. Maintenance Phase

**Role:** Maintenance Engineers / Support Team

**Activities:**

- Fix post-release bugs.
- Implement minor enhancements.
- Ensure stable and continuous operation.

**Output:**

- Updated and Stable Software

### Key Characteristics of the Waterfall Model

- Sequential execution of phases.
- No overlapping or iteration.
- Best for projects with **clear, fixed requirements**.
- Easy to manage but less flexible to changes.
