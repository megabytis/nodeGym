# 🧠 Notes & Code

This repo contains my **notes** and **code experiments** from the [Namaste Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3N9i_KvKZYP4F84FPIzgPQ) YouTube course by **Akshay Saini**.

My goal is to **understand Node.js deeply**, not just use it. So this repo documents each core concept I learn, along with simple `.cjs` code examples for practice.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder represents a specific topic covered in the course, and includes:

- `notes.md` – my personal understanding, key points, diagrams (sometimes)
- `*.cjs` – small code snippets testing the concept in real-time
