#### Synchronous Operations in Node.js

(Like a Linear Food Order Queue)

"Synchronous" = Finish one task completely before starting the next.

## ------- Example Scenario -------

Timeline (minutes):
0 5 10 15
|─────|─────────|───────|──────|
[Coke] [Noodles] [Pizza] [Fries]

Order Queue by persons:
person-1. Coke [0 min] : will wait 0 minutes
person-2. Noodles [5 min] : will wait 5 minutes
person-3. Pizza [10 min] : will wait 15 minutes
person-4. Fries [15 min] : will wait 30 minutes
person-5. Noodles [5 min] : will wait 35 minutes
person-6. Coke [0 min] : will wait 35 minutes

=> Total time till 6th person: 35 minutes

so here we have a synchronous operation where each person waits for the previous person to finish their order before placing their own order. This ensures that the orders are processed in the correct order and that there are no conflicts or delays in the food preparation process.

-> here look at the person-6, it's taking 50 minutes to get a coke, which should take only 0 minutes 🤣, but it's a synchronous operation, so it has to wait for the previous person to finish their order. This is because SYNCHRONOUS OPERATIONS are executed one after the other, and the next operation cannot start until the previous one is completed.

-> this is BLOCKING OPERATION

#### Asynchronous Operations in Node.js

(Like a Fast Food Drive-Thru with Multiple Windows)

"Asynchronous" = Start tasks immediately and handle them when ready, without waiting.

Order Queue by persons:
person-1. Coke [0 min] : instantly served
person-2. Noodles [5 min] : cooking will be started & 2nd person will wait in waiting area
person-3. Pizza [10 min] : cooking will be started & 3rd person will wait in waiting area
person-4. Fries [15 min] : cooking will be started & 4th person will wait in waiting area
person-5. Noodles [5 min] : cooking will be started & 5th person will wait in waiting area
person-6. Coke [0 min] : instantly served

so here we have an asynchronous operation where each person can place their order without waiting for the previous person to finish their order. This ensures that the orders are processed in the correct order and that there are no conflicts or delays in the food preparation process.

-> just after serving coke to person-1, immediately noodle's is gonna be prepared, after person-2 goes to waiting area, pizza will be prepared, after person-3 goes to waiting area, fries will be prepared after person-4 goes to waiting area, E.F.Noodles will be prepared after person-5 goes to waiting area, and coke will be served to person-6 instantly.

-> so, let's calculate, from starting after 5 minutes person-2's noodles will be ready, then again 5 minutes later both 5th person's noodles(5minute after person-2's noodles) & 3rd person's pizza(10minute after person-2's noodles) will be ready together, and then 5 minutes later 4th person's fries(15minute after person-2's noodles or 5minute after person-5's noodles / 5 minute after person-3's pizza) will be ready.

=> Total time till 6th person: 15 minutes(vs 35 mins in sync!)

-> this is NON-BLOCKING OPERATION

**_ Why Async Wins _**

✅ Faster overall throughput
✅ Better user experience (no frozen apps)
✅ Scalable for I/O-heavy tasks (APIs, databases)

    "Use async for anything that involves waiting (files, networks, DBs). Sync only for quick startup tasks."

###### Synchronous vs Asynchronous Execution in Node.js

#################################
Synchronous Operations (Blocking)
#################################

```js
var a = 1078698;
var b = 20986;

function multiplyFn(x, y) {
  const result = x * y; // Corrected parameter usage
  return result;
}

var c = multiplyFn(a, b); // Blocks until completion
```

--> line by line code execution & here is the v8 engine Workflow 👇

**_ V8 Engine Workflow _**

    Call Stack:

        multiplyFn() gets pushed/popped from stack

    Memory Heap:

        Stores variables a, b, c

    Garbage Collector:

        Cleans up after function execution

**_ Step-by-Step Process _**

1.  Global Execution Context Creation

    Call Stack: Pushes Global Execution Context (GEC).

    Memory Heap: Allocates space for variables (a, b, c) and multiplyFn.

    Variables Stored:

    a: undefined // Hoisting phase
    b: undefined
    c: undefined
    multiplyFn: <function reference>

2.  Variable Assignment

    Memory Heap Updates:

    a: 1078698 // Actual value assigned
    b: 20986

3.  Function Invocation

    Call Stack: Pushes multiplyFn() execution context on top of GEC.

    New Execution Context Created:

    x: 1078698 // Parameters initialized
    y: 20986
    result: undefined

4.  Mathematical Calculation

    CPU Operation:

        Multiplies x * y (calculated in CPU registers).

    Memory Heap: Stores result:

    result: 1078698 \* 20986 = 22,637,921,028

5.  Return Value

    Call Stack:

        return result sends value back to c in GEC.

        multiplyFn() execution context is popped from stack.

    Memory Heap Updates:

    c: 22,637,921,028

6.  Garbage Collection

    After Completion:

        Garbage Collector clears multiplyFn's execution context (variables x, y, result).

        Global variables (a, b, c) persist until program ends.

######################################
Asynchronous Operations (Non-Blocking)
######################################

```js
// 1. Network Request
https.get("https://bhagavadgita.io/api", (res) => {
  console.log("secret data:" + res.secret);
});

// 2. File System Access
fs.readFile("./gossip.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
  console.log("File Data", data);
});

// 3. Timed Operation
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Wait here for 5 seconds");
}, 5000);
```

**_ Event Loop Workflow _**

    Callback Queue:

        Receives completed async operations

    Event Loop:

        Moves callbacks to Call Stack when empty

    Worker Threads:

        Handle I/O operations (libuv)

**_ Step-by-Step Process _**

1.  Async Function Call

    Call Stack: Pushes https.get().

    Memory Heap: Stores the callback function.

    libuv: Network request sent to OS kernel (non-blocking).

    Call Stack: https.get() is popped (not waiting!).

2.  Continue Execution

    Call Stack: Runs console.log("Next line...").

    Output:
    text

    Next line runs immediately!

3.  Async Completion

    OS Kernel: Finishes network request.

    libuv:

        Adds callback to Callback Queue.

        Event Loop checks if Call Stack is empty.

4.  Callback Execution

    Event Loop: Moves callback to Call Stack.

    Call Stack: Executes console.log("Data:", res.secret).

    Output:
    text

    Data: [classified]

5.  Memory Management

    Garbage Collector:

        Cleans up res object after callback finishes.

        Preserves https module for reuse.

###### How Node.js Gives JavaScript "Superpowers"

JavaScript (via V8 Engine) alone can't access these stuffs, which are present in an OS 👇

    Filesystem

    Network (HTTP/TCP)

    Databases

    Timers

    OS APIs

so, nodeJs comes in Play ....
JS access ☝️ above stuffs via: "libuv" (the SUPERHERO), which is given by nodeJs

**_ real STEP _**
codes(API calls, readFiles, timeOut etc...) in js -----V8 sends them to----> libuv ---access---> stuffs in OS to get response -----> response sent back to V8 -----> V8 then executed them & show result

==> 'libuv', written in C, has made Async I/O simple

**_ Node.js Architecture Diagram _**
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│           JavaScript          │ <-- Your Code (e.g., `fs.readFile()`)
├───────────────┬───────────────┤
│ V8 Engine     │ C++ Bindings  │ <-- Converts JS to native OS calls
├───────────────┴───────────────┤
│             libuv             │ <-- Handles async I/O & event loop

└───────────────────────────────┘

👆 here,
Key Components:

    V8 Engine

        Executes JS code.

        Manages memory (Heap) and call stack.

    C++ Bindings

        Bridge between JS and OS APIs.

        Powers modules like fs, http, crypto.

    libuv

        Implements the event loop.

        Manages threads for async operations (files, timers, network).

    OS Layer

        Raw access to files, sockets, processes, etc.
